tools(test):it's not working for kd2(only kd2descrypt/encrypt codes work fine)

patcher:creates a launcher called kd2modlauncher.exe to load the "modf" folder and confmf.ini file(instead of loading the "data" folder and the config.ini file)

how to modify:
use DXExtract to extract the .dat files, after that you have two options: back up the "data" folder and move the extracted folders to it (moving the .dat files to another place).

Or use the patcher (needs to be in the same folder as koumajou2.exe)
and move the extracted folders to the modf folder (if necessary, create it, it must be in the same folder as the exe, in addition to that the folder must contain all the files from the data folder in it, whether .dat files or the extracted folders with their files)
